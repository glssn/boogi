This is how you’ll find all online learning courses you need to complete to remain operational as a first aider. You can find it via the Connect homepage. 

As a member of Warwick, you shouldn’t have much trouble navigating Learning Online — each section is a Moodle page. If you’re already logged into Moodle with your Warwick log-in, you might have trouble logging out and back in with your SJA log-in, so it’s a good idea to use a different browser or an Incognito tab.

Once online learning sections are completed, a certificate can be downloaded. Be sure to download these certificates as they are required as proof for volunteers wishing to upskill.

Certain sections in Learning Online are only valid for a certain period of time, usually a year. Be sure to check that all relevant online learning sections are completed to remain operational as a volunteer.
