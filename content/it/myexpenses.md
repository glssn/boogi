MyExpenses is usually used for our volunteers to claim back on expenses relating to events. Typically we claim back on travel expenses to events, or on larger whole-day events we can claim back for food. You can find it via the Connect homepage. 

The Unit Manager can approve expenses below £50, as long as you keep receipts for everything.
