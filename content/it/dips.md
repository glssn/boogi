DIPS (pronounced *dips*) is an old system used to book volunteers onto events. You need separate login information, not the same as your Connect login. There are generally two levels of DIPS access for our unit.

Volunteers all have access to see the upcoming events, but not to book themselves on. On the event page, you can see relevant information, such as the location, timings, and health and safety information.Â 

Privileged access is given to:

* Unit Manager
* Events Lead
* Training Lead

These people are able to book other unit volunteers onto the events. **Remember, all volunteers wishing to book onto events must talk to the Events Lead first.**
