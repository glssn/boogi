All SJA volunteers will be given an email address of their own, usually in the format of *firstname.lastname@sja.org.uk*. You can use this to log into Microsoft Office, just as you would to access your Warwick email account. This also means you have access to the online versions of Word, Excel, and other functions of Office through this log-in. 

If you’re already logged into Office with your Warwick account on your browser, you’ll have difficulty logging into your SJA one. The easiest way to access Office with your SJA login is by doing so via another browser, or an incognito window. You can also download the Microsoft Outlook app on your phone and log into your SJA email account from there.

You should check your emails to this address often, as this is the first way you’ll be contacted for anything to do with your volunteering.
