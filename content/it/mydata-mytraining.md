## MyData

MyData is where you can see all of your volunteering hours and qualifications. You can also log any non-clinical hours here, if you volunteer for SJA in other ways. You can find it via the Connect homepage.

## MyTraining

You can see the upcoming courses for upskilling and maintaining your clinical level on MyTraining. You can use it to book onto courses, but you should contact the Training Lead before you do so. You can find it via the Connect homepage. 

You should also contact the Training Lead if you’re looking to upskill, even if there’s not an upcoming course.
