title: The Care Quality Commission
order: 4
draft: false

The CQC is an independent regulator which can drop in to any of our events unannounced and inspect the quality of care you are giving to patients. St John is legally bound to demonstrate that we meet the standards set out by CQC, and we may be stopped from delivering some of our services if we fail to meet these standards.

More information about what the CQC is looking for can be found [here](https://sjaconnect.me/Quality/CQC/Pages/CQC.aspx).
