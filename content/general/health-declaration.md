title: Health Declaration
order: 5
draft: false
---
If you have a health condition that you think could affect your ability to carry out your role as a volunteer, you should submit a Health Declaration. This is a form you can find on Connect, which asks you to provide some information about your health condition and how it affects you. You should also complete a Supplementary Health Questionnaire, where you can tell SJA what adjustments you need on events to be able to carry out your role. You can also find this on Connect. You should submit both by emailing them to HR ([volunteeringwest@sja.org.uk](mailto:volunteeringwest@sja.org.uk)). 

Information about your health will be kept confidential and will only be seen by HR and an SJA doctor who must review them to give approval for you to continue in your role with the appropriate adjustments in place. You should inform your Unit Manager that you’ve submitted the forms and what adjustments you need, and you may need to inform an Event Manager of these adjustments too, but you’re never expected to disclose information about your health to them.
