You can currently order extra uniform if you are a hospital volunteer, where back-to-back shifts make washing your uniform difficult. You can do this by filling in the MySDU form [here](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=-zfQkRRH6E-whGjAg7gZP5_HuEjnvLlMnWBGmV7nzn5UNURSQjVVODlMU0hVV05BN1hCUFRRRkdHMiQlQCN0PWcu).

You will then need to arrange with the District Logistics Officer, Ben Hogan ([ben.hogan1@sja.org.uk](mailto:ben.hogan1@sja.org.uk)), to collect this from the SJA HQ in Coventry.
