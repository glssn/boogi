Some SJA roles with lots of moving and handling require steel toe cap safety boots, however this is not required for the Event First Aider role.

They are wearing Plain and appropriate rank slides, a role bar, a white round neck tee shirt, no tee shirt sleeves showing, a St John belt, combat trousers, black socks, and black shoes or safety boots.](/content/images/uniform.png "Two volunteers wearing SDU.")

When wearing SDU (Service Delivery Uniform, the official name for our uniform), your role bars and epaulettes should be visible at all times. This means if you wear a soft shell (the SDU light jacket not pictured) or a parka, you should put your role bars and epaulettes on the outer layer of your clothing. When on an event as a first aider, you should wear a role bar with your clinical role on it (First Aider, Advanced First Aider etc.), not any non-clinical role you may have (e.g. Demonstrator, Badger Helper), and plain epaulettes.
