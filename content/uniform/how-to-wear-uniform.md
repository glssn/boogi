When you get your uniform, there’s a few things you’ll need to do before you can wear it operationally. The belts are one-size, and may need to be trimmed to be worn for the first time. You can do this with the scissors included in the first aid kits. 

Typically the trousers you will receive will be **very** long. Most volunteers have turned up their trousers to make them shorter in the leg. We advise you to either cut and sew the ends of the trousers up, or use iron-on hemming web.

St John Ambulance is planning to introduce PPE kits, and when that happens we’ll be adding some information on them here, but donning and doffing PPE is a part of the Event First Aider training you have received.
