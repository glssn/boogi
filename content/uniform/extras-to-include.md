When wearing uniform, you should adhere to the bare-below-the-elbow rule. You are allowed to wear long-sleeved tops underneath your SDU shirt, especially in the winter on cold events, but you should always roll them up when seeing to a patient. 

You aren’t permitted to wear watches while delivering first aid. Knowing the time is, however, really useful on events, as there’s lots of sections for it on the PRF, and it’s needed to take good observations. We usually provide fob watches, which can be worn on your shirt.

You’re not allowed to wear jewellery other than a wedding ring, or anything worn for cultural or religious reasons. You’re allowed to wear a hair covering for religious reasons, such as a hijab, and wearing your SDU baseball cap or beanie is fine. 

It’s a great idea to have your own pen, and keep at least one on your uniform. Your shirt and soft-shell both have pen holders on the upper sleeve. You have to use black pens for PRFs, so make sure it’s the right colour. 

You must carry a safeguarding card and your SJA ID card on you at all times when in uniform.

It’s also a good idea to have a pair of disposable gloves on you when on an event, in a small clear bag. We usually can provide hand sanitiser which clips onto your belt too, which is useful.
