Every unit is run by a Unit Leadership Team (ULT). In our unit, this includes:

* Unit Manager (who is also the President of the society), who oversees the unit’s day-to-day activity
* Training Lead, who oversees your training and clinical competency
* Events Lead, who coordinates the unit’s events and can book you onto them 
* Equipment and Logistics Lead, who is responsible for all our equipment

When you fill in some forms, for example for training purposes, you may be asked for your Line Manager. This is your Unit Manager. 

Your ULT for 2021/22 are:

* Unit Manager: Bethan Hewitt ([bethan.hewitt@sja.org.uk](mailto:bethan.hewitt@sja.org.uk))
* Training Lead: Emma Cogswell ([emma.cogswell@sja.org.uk](mailto:emma.cogswell@sja.org.uk))
* Events Lead: Tiago Dinares ([tiago.dinares@sja.org.uk](mailto:tiago.dinares@sja.org.uk))
