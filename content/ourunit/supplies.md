The gases cupboard, one of our storage cupboards which is behind the SU building on campus, contains our first aid kits and additional stock, parkas, and of course medical gases.



## Access

The gases cupboard is accessed by opening the key safe and using the key. We’ll be replacing the key safe soon so stay tuned on this section. 

## Withdrawing supplies

The lead name should know how many first aid kits are required for the event. Quickly visually inspect the first aid kit to make sure there’s enough supplies. Check especially that there are sufficient numbers of ice packs, PRFs, and PPE.

Sign out the AEDs needed for your event (this is covered later on).

Take a parka if you need to, as it can get chilly standing around on events. If there are any first aiders who will be joining later on, you might want to pick up a parka for them too.

If the event requires it, take a high-vis jacket each.

### Medicines

Each first aid kit’s medicine pack has a corresponding sign-out sheet based on its pack code. Sign out the medicines pack using the correct sign-out sheet in the gases cupboard (this is covered later on).

If the med pack is not tagged (the tag is the piece of plastic covering the zip) when you take the first aid kit out, then let the Equipment and Logistics lead know (or the Unit Manager currently).

## Using supplies

First aid kits are standardised — they should be stocked in this layout:

Ensure PPE is used when appropriate and medical waste is placed in the orange bag. While on events, keep a mental note of what you’ve used as you’ll be expected to replenish this from the stores later.

### Medicines

To open the med pouch, pull the zip and the tag will break and fly off.

Every time you administer medicines from the med pouch, you should record this on both the PRF and the medicines log book, which is inside the pouch. Remember, each row in the log book represents one tablet, so you should fill in two rows if you gave a patient two tablets.

## Replenishing supplies

After the event, replenish the first aid kit using the stores of supplies in the gases cupboard. If the stores are inadequate to completely restock the kit, or if you use the final item from the stores, let the Equipment and Logistics Lead know (or the Unit Manager currently).

First aid kits, AEDs, carry sheets etc. are all expected to be clean. There are cleaning supplies in the cupboard. Carry sheets should be folded correctly and wiped down each time they are used.

### Medicines

Check that the medicines log book correctly represents the stock of medicines in the med pack. If any of the medicines in the log book are in the shaded area, let the Equipment and Logistics Lead know (or the Unit Manager currently). Do not tag the medicine pack red.

Next, tag the med pouch white. Be careful with the orientation of the small tip on the tag. This can break if the tag is upside-down.

Finally, sign the med pack back in on the corresponding sheet you used before the event.
