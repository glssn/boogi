Unit nights are informal training sessions, which happen on campus once a week during Terms 1 and 2. They are mandatory for volunteers to attend. During unit nights you will recap and enhance your clinical skills, with time to practice them in scenarios.

The Training Lead is in charge of coordinating sessions but they may be run by a variety of people. There will be time afterwards for the Events Lead to speak with volunteers and book them onto events.
