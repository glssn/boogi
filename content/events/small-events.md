As a unit, we cover lots of events on campus. For example, weekly sports events on either the Westwood or Cryfield sports pitches, university open days, and graduations. Typically these events don’t need too many first aiders; we usually get away with two.

Before the event, the Events Lead or the lead name on the event will usually make a group chat on Facebook to organise a time and place to meet to prepare (or via email if you’re not on Facebook). We usually meet by the gases cupboard. If you’ve agreed to arrive later than the event start time, then also agree where you’re meeting the rest of the volunteers in advance, and ensure that you have their contact details in case you get lost.

While weekly sports events on campus are normally listed on DIPS as finishing at 5pm, there are still responsibilities for you after the event is over. Walking back to gases, completing paperwork, and restocking kit can mean that you aren’t finished for another hour.

## Lead name

As you become an experienced first aider, you may be lead name on a few events. As lead name, you’re responsible for giving other first aiders a briefing at the start of the event, which might include details on the event itself, the location, and facilities available. You’ll also need to fill out a few extra forms and make the executive decisions on the event. Being lead name doesn’t mean you’re in charge of the first aid itself though -- whichever first aider has the most clinical experience has that responsibility.

To be lead name, you have to have completed the Event Manager Foundation course. When you feel you are experienced enough to take on the above responsibilities on events, you should talk to the Training Lead before booking onto this course via MyTraining. 

## Additional equipment

Some one-off on-campus events require additional equipment to run properly.

Occasionally we will require a large gazebo from Coventry HQ if we are running a treatment centre on campus. The gazebo and sandbags can be stored in Narnia (our storage cupboard inside the SU building), at a bit of a squeeze. For these events, we sometimes use the large St John Ambulance flag which can be found in Narnia, to signpost to others who we are. If you’re able, you might be asked to help set up and take down the gazebo before and after the event. 

Folding camping chairs can be taken to events where volunteers may have difficulty standing for long periods of time. These chairs are stored in Narnia.

For open days, when there are lots of people who are unfamiliar with campus, we have laminated campus maps to help direct people who are lost. These maps can be found in the paper tray in the gases cupboard.
