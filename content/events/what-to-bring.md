There’s always a lot of questions about what you can and can’t bring to events, so we’ll try to clear some of that up!

Yes, you can bring lunch, snacks, and a drink.

Yes, you **should** bring your phone. Make sure it’s charged, as it’s your means of communication if you get separated from other first aiders on the event. Be sure to swap numbers/social media with them in case this happens. 

Yes, you can bring a bag, but you may not be able to keep it with you on larger events. You’ll have plenty of pockets when in uniform though, especially if you wear a parka. 

You can also bring work, a book etc. to pass the time. 

Make sure to layer up on winter events, and you can bring hand warmers and hot drinks to keep you warm.
