At large events, you typically will be interacting with St John people from outside our unit. We usually cover large local events such as Coventry half-marathon, or football matches at Aston Villa. We also cover national, annual events like London Marathon and Wimbledon.

We usually don’t have to bring our own supplies to large events; first aid kits are provided on arrival, or you’ll be working out of a first aid room. You may need to communicate with a wider range of people, like the event manager or event security. You might also need to use radios.

While you are almost guaranteed to be able to book onto smaller events, larger events can be competitive, and there’s no guarantee that you’ll be able to take part.
