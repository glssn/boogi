The Events Lead should make you aware of the events that you can attend in the weekly events email, and/or at the end of unit nights. Contact the Events Lead to get booked on.

If you cannot make an event that youâ€™ve already booked onto, be sure to let the Events Lead know as soon as possible, and a replacement first aider can be arranged.
