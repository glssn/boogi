PRFs, IRFs, sign-out sheets, batch headers. There’s a lot of paperwork that goes into volunteering.

## Patient Report Forms (PRFs)

Every time you treat a patient, you should complete a PRF.

**TODO:** *include a typical header of the PRF for our on campus events*

If you make a mistake, then put a line through it and sign your initials next to the mistake. For example if your initials were NG, and you made a mistake, then the PRF may look like this:

> Pt. was ~~tripped~~ NG running and fell

PRFs have two sections, A and B. Section A is limited in scope, and used when simple observations and treatment are needed. You may need to write into section B, where more complex observations and treatment are needed. It’s fine to start on section A then realise that section B would be more appropriate.

It is not always necessary to complete all sections of the PRF, for example, there is a question on the PRF which says,

> Was the patient FAST positive?

Only answer this if you actually did a FAST test on a patient, which isn’t always needed.

Always open the PRF out fully when you fill it in, making sure it’s not folded over on itself. Underneath the layer of paper you write on is another layer which is a carbon copy of the first one, meaning whatever you write on the top layer will also show up on the bottom one. When you discharge the patient you should offer them the bottom layer to keep. 

If you flip a PRF over, you’ll see a page of text which offers some advice on how to fill in a PRF, what acronyms you can use in your notes, and how to take some observations. 

## Incident Report Forms (IRFs)

An IRF must be used to report all incidents or near misses. An incident is a circumstance which may cause harm, loss or damage to an individual or the charity. A near miss is a circumstance which could have caused an incident.

You must submit an IRF if a volunteer is involved in any of the following (non-exhaustive list):

* administering the wrong treatment or medication
* medical device failure
* slips, trips and falls
* injuries and illnesses on events
* sharps injury

In any case where an IRF should be submitted, or you are unsure, you should speak to your Unit Manager first.

You can report incidents using the “Incident Report Form” button at the bottom of the Connect homepage.

## Sign-out sheets

Before any campus event, or event where you’re required to take equipment out of the gases cupboard, you’ll need to sign out the equipment you take with you. This usually includes first aid kits, AEDs, and meds pouches. When you return the equipment to the gases cupboard, you’ll need to sign them back in. 

This provides a record of what was taken or used where and when, by whom. The sheets to do this, which we call sign-out sheets, are at the bottom of the gases cupboard, near where the PRFs are kept. 

If you go to sign out a piece of equipment and find it wasn’t signed back in when it was last used, even though the equipment itself is there in the gases cupboard, leave a line on the sign-out sheet blank and contact the Equipment and Logistics Lead (or the Unit Manager currently). It’ll most likely have happened because the last person to sign out that piece of equipment forgot to sign it back in when they returned it.
