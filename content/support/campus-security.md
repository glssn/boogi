Campus security is a part of Wellbeing Support Services at Warwick. They aim to safeguard everyone in the campus community. If youâ€™re on campus and need support of any capacity, phone campus security.

For emergencies on campus, you should phone the emergency security line: **024 7652 2222**. This includes requiring an ambulance on events. 

**You should not personally phone 999 for on-campus emergencies as emergency services are unable to navigate the university**. Campus security will call for emergency services and escort them to the correct location on campus.

Their general 24-hour phone number is **024 7652 2083**. Use their [website](https://warwick.ac.uk/services/campus-security/about/) to find out more about how they can support you.
